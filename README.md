# Capstone

Welcome to my Capstone project! Feel free to read the summary report first, titled: "Timeseries Analysis of Bitcoin in the Context of Cryptocurrencies"
That should help you gain an understanding of what this project is all about.

If you want to follow the process of this project from start to finish, please read the notebooks in this order. Notebook 2 and 3 are very similar,
and both dont need to be read. That being said, Notebook 2 contains more information regarding the Feature Engineering Process as it deals with resampling from lower time frames

Notebook Order: 

1:  Acquiring and Cleaning Historical Price Data for Cryptocurrencies.ipynb 

2:  Bitcoin Historical Price Data Feature Engineering for 5-Minute Intervals.ipynb

3:  Bitcoin Historical Price Data Feature Engineering for 1-Day Intervals.ipynb

4:  Bitcoin Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb

5:  Bitcoin Modelling Part 1 SARIMAX.ipynb

6:  Bitcoin Modelling Part 2 - Facebook Prophet.ipynb
